### [Milestone 4](https://github.com/systers/language-translation/pull/133) ###

#### [Blog Post](http://rupinderwadali.github.io/search/) ####

This milestone is not the part of the proposal but while working on the app I found some bugs like search bar is not working and the Signup form of Devise did not have the field of location (country and site). By default the country of the user is Micronesia. When we select the country after registration, it did not show that country in the country tab. So I first fix these issues.

### [Milestone 7](https://github.com/systers/language-translation/pull/136) ###

#### [Blog Post](http://rupinderwadali.github.io/react/)

Assign the role to users as contributor and volunteers. It had been done previously but try to refactor the code. Firstly I tried to create a new view for the assign role but shows error of the react component when create a new component in the same view. Then again recombine the show-list and assign react component in a single component that render in a single view page. Add the can? method helper so that only admin can add and remove the roles of the users.

### [Milestone 10]()

#### [Blog Post](http://rupinderwadali.github.io/offline/) ####

The offline feature of the application is not yet completed but to accomplish this feature we need to develop a SPA (Single Page Application). So we first convert PLT project to SPA using ember. SPA in Ember (backend in Rails, frontend in Ember and the frontend asks for data in JSON calls). Ember will store some data in the frontend, you can probable tell it to fetch more (to work offline) and to store it in LocalStorage.

### [Milestone 11](http://rupinderwadali.github.io/Clean_up/)

I pushed the code of all issues in a single pull request. So it was quite difficult to merge the code and my mentors told me to clean-up the code of the repository. I need to create new branches corresponding to each issue that have the code which address to the specific issue.

### [Milestone 12](https://enigmatic-shelf-39946.herokuapp.com/)

#### [Blog Post](http://rupinderwadali.github.io/Deploy/) ####

Deploy the code to heroku for the testing.

Thanks :)
