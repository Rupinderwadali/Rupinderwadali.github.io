## Great Developers (GD) Entry Task ##

**Day 1:**

On Saturday, I send a mail "Re-entry task" to the H.S.Rai sir and after discussing the motive of the joining the Great Developers
group, finally I recieve the mail of sir in which sir told me the entry task of the GD which is "Introduce kivy by making a making a app 
which remind a patient to take medicine and keep record of medicine missed, or taken early or delayed". I was very happy. And start reading about the kivy and its features. 

**Day 2:**

Second day i.e Sunday I was little busy for preparing the aptitude.

**Day 3:**

On Monday, I had spend my whole day in the college due to placement drive of Sapient and after that I intall the kivy on my system and create a simple app "Hello App" and understand the code and read some tutorials.

**Day 4:**

Next day again busy due to placement drive of "Code brews labs" and I had spend my whole day in the college. When I came to the hostel I completed my major project synopsis and a presentation. And I was not felling well to continue the task of kivy I tried but did not understand so I set the alarm at 5:30 am and go to the bed.

**Day 5:**

I continue the task of kivy as I did not know anything about the python and kivy is the library of python. So firstly I read a little bit about the python then start reading the kivy documentation. Then I went to the college and same schedule attending the lectutes and submit my synopsis and giving the presentation and viva of the synopsis. After that when I came back to the hostel I continue the task of kivy and read documentation and the architecture of kivy. I watch some of the videos on the internet about kivy and make the simple apps of different modules while learning the different modules.


**Day 6:**

Today me and my friends celebrate the birthday of my friend and organised a surprise birthday party for my friend. So I spend the whole day with my friend and when I came back I felt so tired but as per the schedule, my work is not complete so I open my laptop and start working on it. Firstly I complete my blogs and then again continue the task of the kivy like Widgets, kv language etc.
