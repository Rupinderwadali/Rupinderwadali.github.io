### Generating the Logs of activities ###

I use the public_activity gme for generating the log of the user's activities. Following are the steps used for generating logs:

**Step 1:** Add the gem in the gemfile.
          
          gem 'public_activity'

run the bundle install

          $ bundle install

**Step 2:** Create a new table activities, model and controller. By using these commands:

          $ rails g public_activity:migration
          $ rake db:migrate
          $ rails g controller activities index
          
**Step 3:** Add the following lines in the models you want to track the acitivities.

         include PublicActivity::Model
         tracked owner: Proc.new{ |controller, model| controller && controller.current_user }
         
**Step4:** In your application_controller file add the following code:

         include PublicActivity::StoreController
         
**Step 5:** Add the following lines in the activities_controller to fetch the value of the owner of the activity. Create a index method 
in the controller and add the following lines:

          def index
          @activities_by_owner = PublicActivity::Activity.where(owner: current_user)
          @activities = PublicActivity::Activity.order("created_at Desc")
          end

**Step 6:** Now add the following lines in the index view of the activity to show the activities of the users:

          <% @activities.each do |activity| %>
           <div class="activity">
            <%= link_to activity.owner.first_name, activity.owner if activity.owner %>
            <%= render_activity activity %>
           </div>
         <% end %>
         
**Step 7:** Create the partials for the tracking the creating, updating and deleting. Create a new folder in the 
views/public_activity/<track_view_name>/_create.html.erb. Same for the updating and deleting.

          <% if activity.trackable %>
           <%= link_to activity.trackable.name, activity.trackable %>
          <% else %>
           which has since been removed
          <% end %>
**Step 8:** Repeat these steps for tracking activities in all the views.

I used the railscast episode #406 for the generating the logs. Here is the link for reference http://railscasts.com/episodes/406-public-activity.
and Sitepoint.com site for the reference https://www.sitepoint.com/activity-feeds-rails/
