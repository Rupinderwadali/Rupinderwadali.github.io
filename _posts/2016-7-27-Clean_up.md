### Clean-Up the repository ###

I push the code of all issues in a single pull request. So it was quite difficult to merge the code and my mentors told me to 
clean-up the code of the repository. I need to create new branches corresponding to each issue that have the code which address
to the specific issue. She told me one command that help to do so which is cherry-pick command. I read some documentation about
cherry-pick command and tried this by creating a new branch it shows some conflicts. I push the code after resolving all the 
conflict. Now it create new branch but it shows all the commits not the specific one. So I discuss this with mentor she assist me.
Following are the commands that is used to create a new branches and push the specific commmit to the branch:
Step 1: Branch 
       $ git checkout -b <branch>

       $ git reset --hard <latest commmit-hash>

       $ git checkout -b <issue-branch>

       $ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
