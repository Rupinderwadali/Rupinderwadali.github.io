## Application Setup

Followig are the steps to set up the application on the system:

1. Fork or clone the PLTcode directory from https://github.com/systers/language-translation
2. Enter the application's root directory.
3. Run the following commands:

$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ bower install
$ rails s

4. Enter localhost:3000 on a web browser

## Problem during setup 

1. Cannot load rails.application.database_configuration (runtime error)
2. Problem in ruby version
3. Same email registration problem while run the rake db:seed
4. Problem during bower install command

## Solutions:

1. **Database configuration error**

  * Move the config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and change the settings like host, username and password accordingly.

2. **ruby version**

  * Set the version of the ruby in this file language-translation/.ruby-version
  
3. **problem arise when run the rake db:seed**
 
  Following are the commands that are used to solve the problem:

  * rake db:drop
  * rake db:create
  * rake db:schema:load (think of this as running all the migrations you've run before)
  * rake db:seed (creates your 100 database users)
  
4. **Missing bootstrap files**

  * $ run the bower install command or $ bundle exec bower install
