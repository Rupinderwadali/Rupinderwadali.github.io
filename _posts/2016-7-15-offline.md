### Application work offline ###

The requirement of the application is to work offline because PLT app work in the area where there is no internet or very low internet. So should make the whole application work offline so that the users can access the application even when they are not connected to the internet. Use the app data, make the changes and sync the data when they find the internet connection. So for implementing this feature, I tried the following things:

* rack-offline gem in rails for offline feature
* HTML 5 offline feature (Offline API)

**rack-offline gem**

rack-offline gem is a Rack and Rails plugin for building offline web applications. I use rack-offline gem with HTML offline feature. I use the App Cache technology that is used to store the application data for the offline working of the application. It generate the file called manifest file which is a simple text file that lists the resources the browser should cache for offline access. So after searched about it I start working on it.

**Implementing the rack-offline**

I use rack-offline in our application with app-cache but the documentation I follow is not up-to-dated so I face some problems. One of them is to include the application manifest in the route.rb file, we use get "/application.manifest" => Rails::Offline instead of match "/application.manifest" => Rails::Offline

Yayy! after solving this bug finally my main welcome page is working offline. But now my next problem is how to include the next pages to work offline. I have no idea how to do so because I already add the manifest attribute in the application.html.erb file that is common for all the views. Now what? So I start finding the way to include the next method to work
